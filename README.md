# Goby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nskins/goby.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nskins/goby) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nskins/goby/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nskins/goby?branch=master)

Goby is a Ruby framework for creating [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game) [RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game). In the past 30+ years, the fine and respectable craft of text RPG development has been forgotten in favor of flashing lights and CGI cutscenes; however, there was once a time when the video game experience meant more than Dynamic Super Resolutionâ„¢.

Text RPG development is a relatively fast and simple process. That's why our mission is to provide the highest degree of functionality, utilizing object-oriented design principles, so that users spend the majority of their time on the *fun* part of video game development: content creation!
