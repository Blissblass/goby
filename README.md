# Goby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nskins/goby.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nskins/goby) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nskins/goby/badge.svg?branch=coveralls)](https://coveralls.io/github/nskins/goby?branch=coveralls)

Goby is a Ruby framework for the swift and easy development of [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game)-[RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game). Have you ever wanted to write your own text-RPG? Due to recent technological advancements and quality of life improvements, it's now easier than 3.1415. Our primary goal in the development of the Goby framework is to provide a high degree of functionality (utilizing object-oriented design) so that end-users need focus only on content creation! WOOHOO!

## Ayara

Welcome to the town of Ayara. By default, this preset game has been included in the framework for the following reasons: (1.) to provide example code for end-users who wish to create their own game, (2.) to present the many features and possibilities of the framework, and, lastly, (3.) to show that games built using the Goby framework are quite fun.

In order to begin your adventure, run the following command:

```ruby ayara/main.rb```

It is recommended to change your Terminal's text size to about 18 or 20. On Ubuntu, try Edit -> Preferences. On Mac OS X, use ⌘+ and ⌘-.
