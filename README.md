# Goby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nskins/goby.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nskins/goby) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nskins/goby/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nskins/goby?branch=master)

Goby is a Ruby framework for creating [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game) [RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game). In the past 30+ years, the fine and respectable craft of text RPG development has been forgotten in favor of flashing lights and CGI cutscenes; however, there was once a time when the video game experience meant more than Dynamic Super Resolution™. I know that's hard to believe.

Our purpose is to provide the highest degree of functionality, utilizing object-oriented design principles, so that users spend the majority of their time on the *fun* part of video game development: content creation! 

## Ayara

Ayara is the preset game included with the framework. By playing Ayara, you'll encounter some of the features and possibilities of the framework. In addition, Ayara provides sample code for users to get started creating their own game. We hope you enjoy! If there's anything you find strange, please feel free to submit an issue!

Run the following command to begin your adventure:

```ruby ayara/main.rb```

It is recommended to change your Terminal's text size to about 18 or 20. On Ubuntu, try Edit -> Preferences. On Mac OS X, use ⌘+ and ⌘-.
